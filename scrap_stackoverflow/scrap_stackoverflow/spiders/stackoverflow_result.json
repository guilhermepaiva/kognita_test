I've tested with simple lines such as \"import numpy\" and \"print 'Hello world'\", and regardless of the environments I've chosen and the packages installed for each, I always get errors which indicate it's using the Python 3.7 environment (numpy package not installed, print statement requires parentheses around the argument).However, when I use the interactive window, it respects the selected environment for the interactive window, and produces the expected results. This even transfers when selecting the environment of the folder containing my script, which matches the environment I've chosen in the main window. It is only when using the \"Start project\" option that it seems to force into using Python 3.7.For further information, my original script had been completely functional, and was written to interface with another software, but then there was a deep, multi-week update to the software (and potentially other things, I was only informed about the status of the software) and ever since then it has been non-functional due to this forced use of Python 3.7.Can anyone tell me why Visual Studio is doing this?
